DataVisualizator - a Java-based data visualization program that allows users to create pie charts and bar charts from their data. The program is designed to be as user-friendly and intuitive as possible (given it's a command line tool), with a simple text interface that guides users through the process of creating their own custom charts in 2 easy steps.

To use the program, users simply enter their data in the form of a phrase that includes the name of the field followed by a space and then the corresponding percentage of the graph as a number. These elements are separated by semicolons. The program then prompts the user to select the type of graph they want to create, with two options currently available: pie chart and bar chart. Once the user has made their selection, the program generates the chosen graph and presents the data in an easy-to-read format.

It's got simple data visualization capabilities, hence this product is perfect for anyone looking to create custom charts and graphs quickly and easily. Whether youâ€™re a data analyst, a business owner, or just someone who wants to visualize their data in a more meaningful way, this program is the perfect tool for the simple jobs.
